    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This Key Lime Pie is bright, creamy, and irresistibly refreshing. Each
      bite delivers a perfect balance of tangy citrus and smooth sweetness, made
      with freshly squeezed key lime juice for that signature zesty kick. The
      filling is luxuriously silky, nestled inside a buttery, golden graham
      cracker crust that adds just the right amount of crunch. Finished with a
      cloud of lightly sweetened whipped cream, this pie is cool, vibrant, and
      bursting with tropical flavor. It’s the kind of dessert that feels like
      sunshine on a plate—simple, classic, and absolutely unforgettable.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
      <li>⅓ cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>½ cup fresh key lime juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lime zest</li>
      <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, and
        melted butter until evenly combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press the mixture firmly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch
        pie dish to form the crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the crust for 8–10 minutes, then remove from the oven and let it
        cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, key
        lime juice, lime zest, and egg yolks until smooth and creamy.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the filling into the warm crust and spread evenly.</li>
      <li>
        Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the center is set but still slightly
        jiggly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and let the pie cool at room temperature for 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or until fully chilled and set.</li>
      <li>
        Before serving, whip the heavy cream and powdered sugar until soft peaks
        form, then spread or pipe over the pie.
      </li>
      <li>Slice, serve chilled, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
