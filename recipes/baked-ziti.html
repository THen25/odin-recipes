    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This baked ziti recipe is a symphony of comforting flavors and textures,
      blending tender ziti pasta with a rich and savory tomato sauce infused
      with aromatic garlic, onions, and Italian herbs. Layers of gooey melted
      mozzarella, creamy ricotta, and sharp Parmesan create a decadent, cheesy
      blanket that browns beautifully in the oven. The dish is hearty and
      satisfying, with a golden crust on top and a bubbling, saucy interior.
      Perfectly balanced between tangy tomato, savory cheese, and pasta, its a
      crowd-pleasing meal that feels like a warm embrace. Whether enjoyed fresh
      out of the oven or as leftovers, its a recipe that delivers joy in every
      bite.
