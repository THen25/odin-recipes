    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Soft in the center with lightly crisp edges, these homemade chocolate chip
      cookies are rich, buttery, and packed with pools of melted chocolate in
      every bite. The brown sugar adds a warm, caramel-like depth while the
      vanilla rounds everything out, creating a classic, bakery-style cookie
      that’s comforting, indulgent, and impossible to eat just one.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>¾ cup brown sugar (packed)</li>
      <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, mix the melted butter, granulated sugar, and brown
        sugar until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the egg and vanilla extract to the sugar mixture and stir until
        fully combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until a soft
        dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>Fold in the chocolate chips evenly throughout the dough.</li>
      <li>
        Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough onto the baking sheet, spacing
        them apart.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 10–12 minutes, or until the edges are set and lightly golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before
        transferring to a wire rack.
      </li>
    </ol>
